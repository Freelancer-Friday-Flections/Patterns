# Red flags

Things that make us think that this might not be a great match, roughly grouped into categories. We want to spot patterns to help us get better.

## Timing

- Super-short timeline. "This has to be done yesterday!" We prefer enough time to do the job properly.

## Scope

- Very vague scope. We don't need a ten page project spec, just solid signposts, clarity on what and why.

## Money

- Client won't talk about money. It can be a sign that they know they don't have enough.
- "We don't really have a budget." Related: wants a mansion, but has money for a shed.
- Just looking for the cheapest service. We don't compete on price.

## Flexibility

- No flexibility on any of time, scope, and money.

## Team

- In a silo away from others working on the project. Projects have the highest chance of success when people work together.
